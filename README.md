# Legacy Fantasy Football

## Origin Story

12 years ago my friends and I began playing Fantasy Football. Within the first season, it completley took over our lives. We live, breathe and talk football. 
Throughout the years of playing many memorable things have happened. 

The term most commonly known as a "sleeper" was coined a foster in my league, due to the emmergence of Arian Foster in 2010. My brother, won 3 championships in the first six years of our league. One member won on autodraft and with Mark Sanchez at the quarterback position. One member talked all summer about "the superstar he was going to draft in the first round" and then drafted David Montgomery his rookie year. 

There are endless stories from the 12 years of my league, and I know every Fantasy League that exists has their own similiar but also hilariously unique stories. 

I have always felt like the modern systems that we play Fantasy in, ESPN, Yahoo, CBS are missing the user experience of fantasy. As Jeff Schaffer says, Fantasy Football is about the quest for individual acheivement and all that goes into it. The endless up and downs, hope and despair, and firendly banter while you compete with one another. 

>Fantasy football is actually an amazing American pastime, because it takes the ultimate team sport, NFL and football, and turns it into the quest for individual achievement. - Jeff Schaffer

I set out to create an application that helps Fantasy Football Leagues retell the narrative of the league. I wanted users to have info and stats from their league at the end of their fingertips. And most importantly I wante to once and for all put to end, the ever argued topic, of who is really the best in the league? 

## User Story

-Users can create a league in LFF, by importing their ESPN Fantasy Football League Id, and Authorization cookies (Espn_s2, and SWID)
-League members can search for a league once it is created in LFF. 
-Users can see a chart displaying the ammount of wins each owner has over the course of the league. 
-Users can see a chart displaying the ammount of points each owner has over the course of the league. 
-Users can see a sortable table that displays the trophy room. Which shows how many playoffs,finals appearences, and championships owners have. 
-Users can see a table that shows each year's standings and records. 

Now these stats are nice, and help paint the league picture. But what was really needed was a finitive way to rank a leagues owners. 

-Users can see the Legacy Ranking board, which shows the legacy points each owner has.
